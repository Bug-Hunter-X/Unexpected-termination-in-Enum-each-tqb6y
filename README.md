This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in Elixir when using `Enum.each` in conjunction with process exits. The `bug.ex` file shows the erroneous code that abruptly terminates the loop before processing all list elements.  The `bugSolution.ex` file provides a corrected approach using a `try...catch` block or a different enumeration function that doesn't halt on exceptions. This example highlights the importance of robust exception handling for reliable code.
